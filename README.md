# Testing

This project uses __pytest__ as the testing framework.

To run the tests, you need to install pytest module into your machine using the command `pip install -U pytest`.
To install the module into specific version such as python 3.6, you may use `python3.6 -m pip install pytest` or suffix the targeted version.

After installing, you can check the version installed using `pytest --version`.

To run the test, simply type in `pytest` into the commandline. To test against specific python version, suffix the version number into  `python`. E.g To test against python 3.6 `python3.6 -m pytest`.
